12:11pm  
Yesterday, I haven't done any important coding in the project so I didn't post or logged it. Today I am going to do some modifications. Also I will try to code only on Windows as there are some issues on dragging and keyboard shortcuts that works well on Mac.

Start: 4:06pm  
First I have to make some adjustments in the calculation of task completion. The start day now shall be included in the duration and the start day should be one (1).

Just added the methods for ```Task``` and ```TaskSegment``` classes for getting the completion day.
End: 4:18pm  

Start: 5:09pm  
WBS is now editted to reflect the changes in the task.
End: 5:23pm
