Not a very long time ago,  
When my mind started to know,  
According to Darwin from when we are low,  
Then how we evolve and slowly we grow.  
  
We were proud, we stand tall,  
But then again, we come back and bow,  
It seems like its heavy, what we hold,  
For everyday we walk, head bent low.  
  
From what I remember when I was a kid,  
My father and uncles, the stories and drinks.  
Today all you see are friends and peers,  
With face and cheers at their palms with screens.  
  
Notice them now and you’ll surely see  
From their own perspective, it’s fine and they’re free  
It’s not always obvious, but come on, don’t they see?  
That they are like bounded, cogged and unfree.  
  
Normally before, what we usually see  
Is a dog wiggling, while tied in a tree  
But look at today, and with electricity  
Hand with the cord, it’s owner can’t flee.
