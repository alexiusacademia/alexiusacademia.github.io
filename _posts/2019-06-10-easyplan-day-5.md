7:49pm  
I resumed coding on the project.
First thing I did was the improvement of the splitter window by applying the live update flag.
Then on the ribbon, instead of using buttons of the contents of ribbon panel, I tried to use toolbars instead and it's more appealing than before so I decided to adapt it.

8:26pm  
Now dinner is over, back to coding :>.
