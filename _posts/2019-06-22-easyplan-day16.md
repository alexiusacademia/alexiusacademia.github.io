7:48am  
This morning, I started on the mouse cursor for task bars. I set it so that it looks like a cursor for moving objects. The only thing that bother mea little bit is it's called ```CURSOR_SIZING``` that's why it was hard to find at first.

The reason I did this is the default action when a bar is hovered is to move its location when dragged.
