This is supposed to Day 10, however, I just made one commit yesterday. That commit was making a false bar that simulates a task split. I haven't added any code since  until today.

I made a false bar because I cannot, as of this writing, make the window refresh work. Everytime I call the redraw method from the event triggered by the split method, the application crashes.
