Start: 7:44pm  
Last night, I fixed the display of the timeline including the type of date for the start date that is being saved with the project. Tonight, I may still be working on the gantt chart and maybe start something new a little.

Going back to what is accomplished last night, I can feel a lot of lag when working on the gantt chart. Maybe I'll look at this first.

Temporarily, I disabled the timeline. I'm thinking of creating the timeline in the future as a different window/object so that I can manipulate it much better. For now, it is disabled.

End: 8:18
