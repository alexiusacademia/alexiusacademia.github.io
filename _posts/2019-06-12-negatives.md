The internet is for the strong-willed only.  
If you are weak, everything about you will change.  
You will be eaten up by the ridiculous standards,  
Of social media at this age.  
  
Body shaming in the online world isn’t new anymore,  
Which leads people to be down at their core.  
Funny thing is, efforts will be made just to shame,  
Like make new accounts just for the sake of fame.  
  
Everywhere you look, you can see a person scroll,  
Everyone can be a potential online troll.  
Looking for a new victim to beat down,  
Turning their smiles into frowns.  
  
It’s a sad world we live in,  
A world that judges quickly,  
Without knowing the real score first,  
Bullies have an unquenchable thirst.    
  
If this is the era that we have to live in,  
A little more patience and a little less keen,  
Face it now and avoid the fall,  
Not be a victim, and join them all.
