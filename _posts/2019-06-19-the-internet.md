On monday, I started a new project. It's a book writing. My initial title is **The Internet**. It won't be too think in terms of pages I hope, but will sure be full with informations. It's about my own observation around me. It doesn't have to represent anybody. Just my observations.  

It's going to be composed of maybe ten to fifteen chapters at maximum. I will try my best to fit everything that I want to express in this little piece and then hope to reach the mind of the people.  

I really hope no one would get mad or frustrated at me about the topics that will be discussed there but no one knows. Feelings cannot be dictated so, just hoping. I'm nearly done with the first chapter and starting on others in a few days maybe. I intend to write it in a non-sequential manner as I've already outlined what will the topics on each chapter be about.
