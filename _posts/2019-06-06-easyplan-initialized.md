## Intro

At six o'clock this evening, I initialized coding on a new project, code named, _easyplan_. This is planned to be a desktop software as of today and will be used as a project management tool.

## Motivation

Now one maybe asking, why build another one of this kind? Well the answer to that is in the project name, it's about simplicity and being easy to use. Most available software now for project management of this kind are too overwhelming especially on simple use cases. To cut the story short, I wanted to build something that is as easy as can get to operate but not that dumb.lol

## The Plan

In here, I will layout a not so specific and less detailed outline of the project.

### The Project object

The project object will consist of the project tasks, calendar management, working time setting, 
organizing the task line (moving, splitting of task), task connections/dependencies, etc.

### The Task object

The task object is responsible for handling task properties, events and task manipulation capabilities.
