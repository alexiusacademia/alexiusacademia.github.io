Intro
===
At six o'clock this evening, I initialized coding on a new project, code named, _easyplan_. This is planned to be a desktop software as of today and will be used as a project management tool.

Motivation
===
Now one maybe asking, why build another one of this kind? Well the answer to that is in the project name, it's about simplicity. Most available software now for project management of this kind are too overwhelming especially on simple use cases.
