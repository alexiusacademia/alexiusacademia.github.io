Start: 9:40am  
Starting from this day, I will be logging the start and end of coding sessions for the _easyplan_ project.
Added a new entry in the ribbon commands, Merge tool. This merges all the splitted task segments.
End: 10:03am  

Start: 11:11am  
The software is broken :(
End: 12:18pm  

Start: 1:20pm
Starting debugging...

1:42pm  
I just made the merging work and the undo. But the redo has some buggy things going. I can't figure out what yet.
