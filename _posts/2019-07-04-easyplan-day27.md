Start: 9:47pm  
I thought I'd go into a little coding so here it is. First was messing with the ribbon. I changed its colour scheme to make it sort of suit my eyes a little by throwing a little shade of blue in there. I think this will be the default. It's not very professional right now but it'll do.

Next is to continue on the project information dialog.
