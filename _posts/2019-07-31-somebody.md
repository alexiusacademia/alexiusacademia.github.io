Everybody wants to be someone's somebody,  
A person that you can call baby,  
Maybe somebody you can spoil with Versace,  
Or just your plain old flirty buddy.  
  
Somebody who can be your clarity,  
With his love and loyalty as a guarantee.  
Your s/o in the future possibly, (s/o = significant other)  
No side chicks hopefully.  
  
Somebody who you fell in love with his personality,  
Not just with the attraction physically.  
You have undeniable connection emotionally,  
Somebody who reduces or removes your anxiety.  
  
Somebody you wanna be with for the rest of your life,  
Somebody you wanna face your problems with,  
Somebody you don't wanna give up on,  
No matter what, somebody you can depend your life upon.
