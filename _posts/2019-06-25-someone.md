Meeting someone unexpectedly is always nice,  
Maybe someone to talk to or give you advice.  
These someones can be our lifetime buddy,  
Not someones that are only after your money.  
  
That someone can be your plain old friend,  
Your seasonal friend, or someone you can depend.  
It can be someone who holds a special place in your heart,  
That has become your favorite part.  
  
This can be someone who will never get tired of you,  
Your mood swings, or whatever you’re going through.  
This can be someone that you can be so very fond of,  
That you’re gonna wanna show him off.  
  
This is a relationship that started with a hello,  
But instant sparks can make you plan your tomorrow.  
Plan your future dreams that you both shall follow,  
Your dreams being a reality, and not being thrown outside the window.  
  
I am lucky as I have found that someone,  
Someone who gets everything done.  
Just like a superhero who is always ready,  
And who is liked by everybody.  
  
But alas, my emotions have ruled me.  
As I only followed my heart with the guarantee,  
The guarantee that together we will never be,  
The universe doesn’t allow it, it wasn’t meant to be.
