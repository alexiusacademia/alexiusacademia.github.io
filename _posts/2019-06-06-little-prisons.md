Life is not the same anymore,  
As modernization took us over  
Like making friends is not personal,  
All of the ways are now digital.  
  
It was now the top pastime of all the people,  
Relentlessly drowning themselves,  
Into an endless pit of high standards and comparison,  
Turning into anxiety and depression.   
  
Nonverbal cues are continually being useless,  
As do body language and facial expressions,  
People don’t care about all of this anymore,  
Smart phones are the ultimate necessity! Unlike before.  
  
Not having phones makes you pay attention to the world around you,  
It can make you appreciate the little things,  
See the beauty of the environment and people,  
Now everybody only cares about is how the number of likes and shares grew.  
  
No one will let their phones die,  
Always have to be a plug or a powerbank nearby,  
It’s about the love that they get online, all the coolness,  
Not long before going into chaos and madness.
