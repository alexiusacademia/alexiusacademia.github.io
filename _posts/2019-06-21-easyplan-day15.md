6:10am  
Messing now with the file functions. I first coded the create file button to save a new file. Later on I will separate this in a new method so that other triggers can use it.

For now, I used '.epn' as project extension file but I'm also open for changing this later if I can think of a better one. Maybe .pln or anything.
