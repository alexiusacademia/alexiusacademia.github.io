Today, I started coding on the project. I plan to host the core codes to github for simplicity of version control plus I just want it to be available to me at all times during the development.

The project will be a commercial software when shipped or ready for production, but for now, since the code is available publicly, it is in the meantime, open source.

I started scaffolding the two main packages of project, the _core_ for the core api and the _gui_ to handle the graphical user interface. As of now, I was barely finished with the constructors of Task and Project class under the _core_ package. Too little time, maybe I will cgive it lot of coding this weekend.

I am using python for this, still not sure though if I am gonna be adding other languages in the future. For the settings, maybe I'll go with sqlite, it will be enough I think, for now.
