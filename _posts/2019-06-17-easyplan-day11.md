7:16pm  
Tonight, I am working on the ribbon. Just adding buttons and functionalities. The page that I'm working is the Project page. It will have the usual, ```New Project```, ```Open Project```, ```Settings```.

Since I have no internet tonight, I cannot push the changes on github. But that's okay since I'm the only one working on this project and I am not using another machine.
