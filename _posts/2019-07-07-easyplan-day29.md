Start: 2:30pm  
Today I was working on the scrollbar at first then I stopped it. Couldn't figure it out just yet so I decided to work on something that I know I can accomplish just a little bit. I am now working on the timeline display.

Dates will be shown per week so I'm gonna fit it in the display so that they don't overlap with the next week's date.
